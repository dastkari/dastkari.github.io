    <br>
    <p>'I began Dastkari Chikan to get handmade embroidery to places far away. Dastkari Chikan pieces are echoes from artisans in the narrow streets of Lucknow to ring in the fashion runways of Paris and Milan. Our vision is a department store for handmade Indian clothing, for women, by women.' - Shaheen Ali Kazmi, CEO</p><p>Dastkari Chikan is owned and operated by Shaheen Ali Kazmi.</p><p>Women run Dastkari Chikan. Women seeded it. Women represent us as brand ambassadors. Women make our pieces. Women buy our pieces. Women critique our pieces. Women inspire our collections.</p>
